The project was created as a challenge from JobConvo for internship at Dev Python and consists as a web app where people can candidate themselves to the job offers that the company has created.

The project can be accessed by https://vagaki.herokuapp.com

ABOUT THE FILES:
	This directory contains the "Vagaki" Django project and the "core" app;
	There is a db.sqlite3 file, with the empty database;
	manage.py is the brain of the project and all commands run at it;
	Procfile, requirements.txt and runtime are the settings for the project to run well;
	The staticfiles folder contains all the static files necessary in the site, but inside the core app there is the local static folder.

The whole apps, projects and files will be written in English; The only exception are the general template's content, which are for brazilian users.

To acces the administration site, must go to https://vagaki.herokuapp.com/admin/;
To administrate the data in the DB, there's a superuser which can be used to manage all this and permissions in the app: 
	Login: generaladmin 
	Password: generalpassword

With this project I learned a lot about backend with Django and loved to create it and know this tool's power. This project was developed by Igor Baiocco Rodrigues. Hope you like it!
